## Understanding JavaScript Objects (`{}`)

In JavaScript, a plain `Object` (`{}`) is a collection of key-value pairs. Traditionally, before `Map` and `Set` were introduced, objects were used to simulate hash maps.

### Characteristics of JavaScript Objects:

* **Key-Value Pairs:** Stores data as `key: value` pairs.
* **Keys are Strings (or Symbols):** All keys in an `Object` are automatically converted to strings (or Symbols). This is a crucial distinction from `Map`.
* **Unordered (Historically):** While modern JavaScript engines generally maintain insertion order for string keys, historically, `Object` key order was not guaranteed. For ordered collections, `Map` is preferred.
* **Not optimized for frequent additions/deletions of arbitrary keys:** While fast, their internal structure isn't always ideal for scenarios requiring very frequent arbitrary key manipulations where strict $O(1)$ average-case performance is critical, like true hash maps.
* **Prototype Chain:** Objects have a prototype chain, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully (e.g., iterating over inherited properties).

### Basic Object Operations:

```javascript
// 1. Declaration
const myObject = {}; // Object literal (most common)
const anotherObject = new Object(); // Using constructor

// 2. Adding / Updating Properties
myObject.name = "Alice";        // Dot notation
myObject["age"] = 30;           // Bracket notation
myObject.city = "New York";

// 3. Accessing Properties
console.log(myObject.name);     // Output: Alice
console.log(myObject["age"]);   // Output: 30

// 4. Checking if Property Exists
console.log("city" in myObject);         // Output: true
console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty("name")); // Output: true (recommended)

// 5. Deleting Properties
delete myObject.city;
console.log(myObject); // Output: { name: 'Alice', age: 30 }

// 6. Iterating
for (const key in myObject) {
    if (myObject.hasOwnProperty(key)) { // Good practice to avoid inherited properties
        console.log(`${key}: ${myObject[key]}`);
    }
}
// Output:
// name: Alice
// age: 30

console.log(Object.keys(myObject));    // Output: [ 'name', 'age' ]
console.log(Object.values(myObject));  // Output: [ 'Alice', 30 ]
console.log(Object.entries(myObject)); // Output: [ [ 'name', 'Alice' ], [ 'age', 30 ] ]
```

## Understanding JavaScript Map (The "True" Hash Map)

The `Map` object was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and is designed to be a more robust and flexible key-value collection compared to plain `Objects` when you need true map-like behavior. It's the closest thing to a "Hash Map" in JavaScript's standard library.

### Characteristics of `Map`:

* **Flexible Keys:** Keys can be *any* data type, including objects, arrays, functions, `null`, `undefined`, numbers, etc. This is the biggest advantage over plain `Objects`.
* **Ordered Insertion:** `Map` objects iterate their elements in insertion order.
* **Better Performance for Dynamic Keys:** Optimized for scenarios where keys are frequently added, deleted, or changed. Average $O(1)$ time complexity for `set`, `get`, `has`, and `delete` operations.
* **No Prototype Chain Interference:** `Map` instances don't inherit properties from a prototype, so you don't have to worry about unintended key collisions (like `hasOwnProperty`).
* **`size` Property:** Directly provides the number of key-value pairs.

### Basic Map Operations:

```javascript
// 1. Declaration
const myMap = new Map();

// 2. Setting Key-Value Pairs
myMap.set("name", "Bob");
myMap.set(1, "one");
myMap.set(true, "truthy");
const myArr = [1, 2];
myMap.set(myArr, "array_key"); // Array as a key!
const myObj = { id: 1 };
myMap.set(myObj, "object_key"); // Object as a key!

console.log(myMap);
// Output:
// Map(5) {
//   'name' => 'Bob',
//   1 => 'one',
//   true => 'truthy',
//   [ 1, 2 ] => 'array_key',
//   { id: 1 } => 'object_key'
// }

// 3. Getting Values
console.log(myMap.get("name")); // Output: Bob
console.log(myMap.get(1));      // Output: one
console.log(myMap.get(myArr));  // Output: array_key (Note: refers to the same array object)
console.log(myMap.get({ id: 1 })); // Output: undefined (different object reference)

// 4. Checking if Key Exists
console.log(myMap.has("name"));    // Output: true
console.log(myMap.has("gender"));  // Output: false
console.log(myMap.has(myObj));     // Output: true

// 5. Deleting Key-Value Pairs
myMap.delete(true);
console.log(myMap.has(true)); // Output: false

// 6. Size of Map
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 4

// 7. Iterating (maintains insertion order)
// Using for...of loop
for (const [key, value] of myMap) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}
// Output:
// name: Bob
// 1: one
// [ 1, 2 ]: array_key
// { id: 1 }: object_key

// Using Map methods
console.log(myMap.keys());     // Output: [Map Iterator] { 'name', 1, [ 1, 2 ], { id: 1 } }
console.log(myMap.values());   // Output: [Map Iterator] { 'Bob', 'one', 'array_key', 'object_key' }
console.log(myMap.entries());  // Output: [Map Iterator] { ['name', 'Bob'], [1, 'one'], [[1,2], 'array_key'], [{id:1}, 'object_key'] }

// 8. Clearing the Map
myMap.clear();
console.log(myMap.size); // Output: 0
```

### When to use `Map` vs. `Object`:

* **Use `Map` when:**
    * You need to use non-string values (objects, functions, etc.) as keys.
    * You need to preserve the insertion order of elements.
    * You need to frequently add or remove key-value pairs.
    * You need the exact size of the collection easily.
    * You want to avoid prototype pollution or inherited properties.
* **Use `Object` when:**
    * You primarily need simple key-value storage where keys are strings (or numbers that get converted to strings).
    * You are defining static properties (e.g., configuration objects).
    * You are creating JSON-serializable data.
    * You are using it as a plain data record with known, fixed properties.

## Understanding JavaScript Set (The "True" Hash Set)

The `Set` object, also introduced in ES6, is a collection of unique values. It's the closest equivalent to a "Hash Set" in JavaScript.

### Characteristics of `Set`:

* **Unique Values Only:** A `Set` will only store unique values. If you try to add a duplicate, it will be ignored.
* **Flexible Values:** Values can be of any data type, similar to `Map` keys.
* **Ordered Insertion:** Elements are iterated in insertion order.
* **Optimized for Uniqueness Checks:** Average $O(1)$ time complexity for `add`, `has`, and `delete` operations.
* **`size` Property:** Directly provides the number of unique elements.

### Basic Set Operations:

```javascript
// 1. Declaration
const mySet = new Set();

// 2. Adding Values (Duplicates are ignored)
mySet.add("apple");
mySet.add("banana");
mySet.add("apple"); // This will be ignored, "apple" is already in the set
mySet.add(10);
mySet.add({ id: 1 }); // Objects are unique by reference
mySet.add({ id: 1 }); // This is a different object reference, so it's added

console.log(mySet);
// Output:
// Set(5) { 'apple', 'banana', 10, { id: 1 }, { id: 1 } }

// 3. Checking if Value Exists
console.log(mySet.has("apple"));     // Output: true
console.log(mySet.has("grape"));     // Output: false
const obj1 = { value: "test" };
mySet.add(obj1);
console.log(mySet.has(obj1));        // Output: true

// 4. Deleting Values
mySet.delete("banana");
console.log(mySet.has("banana")); // Output: false

// 5. Size of Set
console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 5 (initial 5, then added obj1, then deleted banana)

// 6. Iterating (maintains insertion order)
for (const value of mySet) {
    console.log(value);
}
// Output:
// apple
// 10
// { id: 1 }
// { id: 1 }
// { value: 'test' }

// Using Set methods
console.log(mySet.values());   // Returns an iterator of values (same as keys() and entries() for Set)

// 7. Clearing the Set
mySet.clear();
console.log(mySet.size); // Output: 0
```

### When to use `Set`:

* When you need to store a collection of unique values.
* When you need to quickly check for the presence of a value.
* When you need to remove duplicate elements from an array.
* To perform set operations like union, intersection, difference (though you'd implement these manually using `Set` methods).

## Hash Map / Hash Set Concepts

In other programming languages (like Java, Python, C++), `HashMap` and `HashSet` are often explicitly named data structures that rely on a concept called **hashing**.

### How Hashing Works (Conceptual):

1.  **Hash Function:** When you store a key-value pair in a HashMap (or just a value in a HashSet), a `hash function` takes the key (or value) and converts it into a numerical `hash code`.
2.  **Bucket Mapping:** This hash code is then used to determine an index (or "bucket") in an underlying array where the data will be stored.
3.  **Collision Handling:** Multiple keys might produce the same hash code (a "collision"). Hash maps use various techniques (like separate chaining or open addressing) to handle these collisions, ensuring that different keys can still be stored and retrieved uniquely.

### JavaScript's Approach:

JavaScript's `Map` and `Set` internally use hashing (or similar highly optimized lookup mechanisms) to achieve their average $O(1)$ time complexity. You don't directly interact with hash codes or collision resolution. The JavaScript engine handles all of that for you. When we say "Map is the true hash map" or "Set is the true hash set" in JavaScript, it's because they provide the guarantees and performance characteristics of hash-based collections, even if the underlying implementation details are abstracted away.

A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
    * **Concept:** Use a `Set` to detect cycles. If a number is encountered again, it's not a happy number.

    * **Description:** Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `t`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.
    * **Concept:** While `Set` directly doesn't solve this (because it's not ordered), it's a problem often discussed in the context of "similar element in window" which can sometimes leverage `Set` for basic presence checks within a more complex sliding window structure, or more specifically, balanced binary search trees for range queries. (A `Map` or plain object could be used to simulate a frequency map within the window for simpler variations).
