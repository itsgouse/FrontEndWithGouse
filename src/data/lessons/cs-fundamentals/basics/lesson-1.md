## Components of a Computer System

### Memory Units

Memory units are essential for storing data and instructions that the computer needs to access quickly.

* **RAM (Random Access Memory):** This is the **primary memory** of the computer. It's volatile, meaning its contents are lost when the computer is turned off. RAM is used to temporarily store data and programs that the CPU is actively using. The more RAM a computer has, the more applications it can run simultaneously and the faster it can switch between them.
* **Storage (Secondary Memory):** This refers to non-volatile memory that retains its data even when the computer is powered off. It's used for long-term storage of operating systems, applications, and user files. Examples include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs).

### Input Devices

Input devices allow users to send data and instructions to the computer. They are crucial for interactive user interfaces (UIs).

* **Keyboard:** Used for entering text, numbers, and commands.
* **Mouse:** Used for pointing, clicking, dragging, and selecting items on the screen.
* **Touchscreen:** Allows direct interaction with the display using fingers.
* **Microphone:** Used for voice input.
* **Webcam:** Captures images and videos.
* **Scanner:** Converts physical documents or images into digital format.
* **Joystick/Game Controller:** Used for gaming.

### Output Devices

Output devices display or present information from the computer to the user. They are essential for web rendering.

* **Monitor/Display:** The primary visual output device, displaying text, images, and videos.
* **Printer:** Produces hard copies of documents and images.
* **Speakers/Headphones:** Produce audio output.
* **Projector:** Displays computer output onto a large screen.

### Hardware & Software (High-Level Understanding)

* **Hardware:** Refers to the physical, tangible components of a computer system. This includes everything you can see and touch, such as the CPU, RAM, hard drive, keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. Hardware provides the physical foundation upon which software runs. Physical components work together, orchestrated by software, to execute tasks. For example, the CPU performs calculations, RAM stores temporary data, and the hard drive stores persistent data.
* **Software:** Refers to the set of instructions, programs, and data that tell the hardware what to do. It's intangible. Software can be broadly categorized into:
    * **System Software:** Manages and controls the computer's hardware and provides a platform for application software. Examples include Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and device drivers.
    * **Application Software:** Designed to perform specific tasks for the user. Examples include web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, games, and photo editing software.

### Monitor (CRT, LCD, LED)

Monitors are crucial for visual presentation.

* **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube):** Older, bulky monitors that used a cathode ray tube to project images onto a screen. They were large, heavy, and consumed a lot of power. (Mostly obsolete now).
* **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):** Thinner and lighter than CRTs, LCDs use liquid crystals to block or pass light to create images. They are energy-efficient and offer better image quality than CRTs.
* **LED (Light Emitting Diode):** A type of LCD that uses LEDs as backlighting instead of traditional fluorescent lamps. LEDs offer better contrast, brighter colors, and are even more energy-efficient and thinner than traditional LCDs. Most modern displays are LED or variations like OLED (Organic LED) which offer even better black levels and contrast.

### Keyboard & Mouse

* **Keyboard:** A primary input device for entering text, numbers, and commands. Its layout and functionality are directly relevant to how users interact with web forms, search bars, and various applications.
* **Mouse:** A pointing device that allows users to control a cursor on the screen, click on links, select elements, and drag and drop. It's fundamental for navigating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and is extensively used for interacting with web pages.

## Data Storage and Memory

### Bit, Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes

These are units of digital information, crucial for understanding data sizes and performance optimization (e.g., image sizes, asset loading).

* **Bit (b):** The smallest unit of digital information, representing either a 0 or a 1.
* **Byte (B):** A group of 8 bits. It's the fundamental unit for measuring data storage.
* **Kilobyte (KB):** Approximately one thousand bytes ($1 \text{ KB} = 1024 \text{ bytes}$).
* **Megabyte (MB):** Approximately one million bytes ($1 \text{ MB} = 1024 \text{ KB}$).
* **Gigabyte (GB):** Approximately one billion bytes ($1 \text{ GB} = 1024 \text{ MB}$).
* **Terabyte (TB):** Approximately one trillion bytes ($1 \text{ TB} = 1024 \text{ GB}$).

Understanding these units helps in assessing file sizes (e.g., images, videos, documents), network bandwidth requirements, and storage capacity.

### Types of Data Storage

Knowing different types of storage helps in understanding how data is stored and accessed, impacting application performance.

* **HDD (Hard Disk Drive):** Traditional storage devices that use spinning platters and read/write heads to store data magnetically. They offer large storage capacities at a lower cost but are slower and more prone to mechanical failure than SSDs.
* **SSD (Solid State Drive):** Newer storage devices that use flash memory to store data, similar to USB drives. They are significantly faster, more durable, and consume less power than HDDs, but typically have a higher cost per gigabyte.
* **Optical Storage:** Storage mediums that use lasers to read and write data. Examples include:
    * **CD (Compact Disc):** Stores around 700 MB of data.
    * **DVD (Digital Versatile Disc):** Stores up to 8.5 GB of data.
    * **Blu-ray Disc:** Stores up to 128 GB of data.
* **Flash Drives (USB Drives/Pen Drives):** Portable storage devices that use flash memory. Convenient for transferring small to medium amounts of data.
* **Memory Cards (SD Cards, MicroSD Cards):** Small, portable flash memory cards commonly used in digital cameras, smartphones, and other portable devices.
* **Cloud Storage:** Data stored on remote servers accessed over the Internet. Examples include Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Amazon S3. Offers accessibility from anywhere, scalability, and often built-in backup features.

### Computer Memory (Register Memory, Cache Memory, Primary Memory, Secondary Memory, Memory Units)

A basic grasp of memory hierarchy helps in understanding performance bottlenecks and optimization. This hierarchy is designed to provide faster access to frequently used data.

* **Register Memory:** The smallest and fastest memory in the CPU itself. It holds data that the CPU is currently processing. Access is almost instantaneous.
* **Cache Memory:** Small, very fast memory located directly on or near the CPU. It stores copies of data from main memory that the CPU is likely to need next. There are typically multiple levels of cache (L1, L2, L3), with L1 being the fastest and closest to the CPU.
* **Primary Memory (RAM):** As discussed earlier, this is the main working memory of the computer. It's volatile and faster than secondary storage but slower than cache and registers.
* **Secondary Memory (Storage):** Non-volatile, long-term storage (HDDs, SSDs) where the operating system, applications, and user files are permanently stored. It's slower than primary memory but offers much larger capacity at a lower cost.
* **Memory Units:** Refer to the physical chips or modules that comprise the different types of memory (e.g., RAM sticks).

## Basics of Operating System

### What is Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user/application software and the computer hardware. Without an OS, a computer is just a collection of electronic components.

### Functions of Operating System

Understanding these functions at a high level provides context for how browsers and web apps operate.

* **Process Management:** Manages the execution of all programs (processes) on the computer. It allocates CPU time to different processes, ensuring that multiple applications can run concurrently (multitasking). For web browsers, the OS manages the browser process itself and potentially multiple tabs as separate processes.
* **Memory Management:** Allocates and deallocates memory to various programs and data, preventing conflicts and ensuring efficient use of RAM. This is crucial for web browsers to load and render complex web pages efficiently.
* **File Management:** Organizes and manages files and directories on storage devices, allowing users to create, delete, copy, move, and access files. Web browsers use file management to store cached data, downloads, and user settings.
* **Device Management:** Controls and coordinates the operation of all input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, network card, etc.) by providing device drivers. This is how the browser interacts with your network card to access the internet.
* **Security:** Provides mechanisms to protect the system from unauthorized access, viruses, and other threats. This includes user authentication, firewalls, and access control.
* **User Interface (UI):** Provides a way for users to interact with the computer. This can be a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with windows, icons, and menus, or a Command-Line Interface (CLI) where commands are typed.
* **Networking:** Manages network connections, allowing the computer to communicate with other computers and access network resources (like the internet). This is fundamental for the web.

## What is a Web?

The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, often simply called "the Web," is a global system of interconnected hypertext documents and other media accessible via the Internet. It's a vast collection of resources and information, linked together by hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate from one document or resource to another. The "hypertext" aspect means that text contains links to other texts, creating a non-linear Browse experience. The Web is built upon a set of standardized protocols (like HTTP) that enable this interconnectedness and access.

## What is the Internet?

The **Internet** is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It's a massive network of networks, comprising private, public, academic, business, and government networks, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet provides the underlying infrastructure that allows the Web, email, online gaming, and many other digital services to function. Think of the Internet as the roads and highways, and the Web as the content (buildings, shops, etc.) that sits on those roads.

## How the Web Works?

The basic mechanism of how web browsers retrieve content from web servers over the Internet involves a client-server model and specific protocols.

1.  **Client (Web Browser):** Your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) acts as the client. When you type a URL or click a link, you're making a request.
2.  **Server (Web Server):** A web server is a computer program that stores web pages, images, videos, and other web content. It "serves" these resources when requested by a client.
3.  **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** This is the communication protocol used for transferring hypertext documents (web pages) over the Internet. When your browser requests a web page, it uses HTTP.
4.  **Internet Connection:** The request and response travel across the Internet's network infrastructure.

## Simplified Web Request Flow

This high-level overview illustrates the sequence of events from a user initiating a request to content being displayed in the browser.

```
// 1. User types URL (e.g., "www.example.com") into the browser's address bar and presses Enter.
//    Or, clicks a hyperlink on a webpage.

// 2. Browser resolves DNS to IP:
//    The browser needs to find the numerical IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.1) associated with "www.example.com".
//    It contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) resolver to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address.

// 3. Browser sends HTTP Request:
//    Once the IP address is known, the browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server at that IP address.
//    This request asks for the specific web page or resource (e.g., the homepage).

// 4. Server processes request:
//    The web server receives the HTTP request. It locates the requested resource (e.g., "index.html").
//    It might also run server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js) to generate dynamic content.

// 5. Server sends HTTP Response:
//    The web server sends back an HTTP response to the browser.
//    This response includes the requested content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) and an HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK for success).

// 6. Browser renders content:
//    The browser receives the HTTP response. It parses the HTML, applies CSS for styling, executes JavaScript for interactivity,
//    and fetches any additional resources (images, videos) linked in the HTML.
//    Finally, it displays the complete web page to the user.
```

## Client vs Server

* **Client (Browser):**
    * Typically runs on the user's device (desktop, laptop, smartphone).
    * Initiates requests to servers.
    * Renders and displays the content received from the server.
    * Handles user interaction (clicks, typing).
    * Runs client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

* **Server (Web Server):**
    * A powerful computer or program that stores and delivers web content.
    * Waits for and responds to client requests.
    * Processes data, interacts with databases, and generates dynamic content.
    * Runs server-side code (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java).

## Lifecycle of an HTTP Request

The lifecycle of an HTTP request is a more detailed breakdown of the "How the Web Works" section:

1.  **User Action:** User types a URL, clicks a link, or submits a form.
2.  **DNS Resolution:** The browser checks its local DNS cache. If not found, it queries a recursive DNS resolver to find the IP address corresponding to the domain name.
3.  **TCP Handshake:** Once the IP address is resolved, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the web server on port 80 (for HTTP) or 443 (for HTTPS). This involves a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a reliable connection.
4.  **HTTP Request Sent:** The browser constructs and sends an HTTP request message to the server over the established TCP connection. This message includes:
    * **Request Line:** Method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, HTTP version.
    * **Request Headers:** Additional information like user-agent, accepted content types, cookies.
    * **Request Body (for POST requests):** Data submitted by the user (e.g., form data).
5.  **Server Processing:** The web server receives the HTTP request. It identifies the requested resource, performs any necessary server-side logic (e.g., database queries, authentication, generating dynamic HTML).
6.  **HTTP Response Sent:** The server constructs and sends an HTTP response message back to the browser. This message includes:
    * **Status Line:** HTTP version, Status Code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), Status Message.
    * **Response Headers:** Content-Type, Content-Length, Set-Cookie.
    * **Response Body:** The actual content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, JSON data, etc.).
7.  **Browser Rendering:** The browser receives the response body.
    * It parses the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM).
    * It parses CSS to construct the CSS Object Model (CSSOM).
    * It executes JavaScript, which can modify the DOM and CSSOM.
    * It fetches any additional resources (images, stylesheets, scripts) linked in the HTML, often initiating new HTTP requests for each.
    * Finally, it combines the DOM and CSSOM to create the render tree and paints the web page on the screen.
8.  **Connection Termination (or Keep-Alive):** After the content is delivered, the TCP connection may be closed, or kept alive for subsequent requests (HTTP persistent connections) to improve performance.

## Frontend vs Backend Overview

* **Frontend (Client-Side Development):**
    * Deals with the **user interface (UI)** and user experience (UX) of a website or web application.
    * Everything the user sees and interacts with in their browser.
    * Involves languages and technologies that run directly in the browser:
        * **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Provides the structure and content of a webpage.
        * **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Controls the visual presentation and layout of the webpage (colors, fonts, spacing).
        * **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity, dynamic behavior, and complex functionality to the webpage.
    * Frontend developers focus on responsive design, performance optimization for the user, and creating an intuitive interface.

* **Backend (Server-Side Development):**
    * Deals with the **data, logic, and infrastructure** that power the frontend.
    * Everything that happens "behind the scenes" on the server.
    * Involves server-side programming languages and technologies:
        * **Programming Languages:** Python, Node.js (JavaScript), PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Go.
        * **Frameworks:** Django, Flask (Python), Express.js (Node.js), Laravel (PHP), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Spring (Java).
        * **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.
        * **Servers:** Apache, Nginx (web servers).
    * Backend developers focus on managing data, handling user requests, implementing business logic, ensuring security, and optimizing server performance.
